      <h3 class='about_content'><img src="images/chris.jpg" id="about_img" align="left">I create something out of nothing when writing code, and that is a beautiful feeling.  Programming allows me to take an idea and make it a reality while giving it my own personal touch, much like an artist. Problems are frequently encountered in software engineering. I have found that I will not always know the answer and thatâ€™s ok. These instances provide learning opportunities where I can increase my skill level. I find uncovering solutions to complex problems extremely rewarding and intriguing, especially when the process is shared with a team. Being a part of a team makes projects and programming even more enjoyable. A strong team can make good programmers better and suitable work great. I hope to join a company with a good programming team that I can continue to grow in and be a part of. <br /><br />While completing my CS degree, I studied many different programming languages and maintained a 3.8 GPA. This earned me a spot on the Dean's List for each semester. Outside of development, I enjoy working out, video games, traveling, and spending time with my wife, family and friends. I also have development projects that I am working on in my free time. I am working to create a more complete nutrition calculation application that leaves zero guess work on the part of the user. If I sound like a fit for your team or need, please fill out the form on the contact page.
